            <p>The X-series is my favorite scifi-space game series. It was created by the small developer team "Egosoft"
                in WÃ¼rselen. Building space stations with the module sandbox system is the most fun. It requires a lot of planning
                though, if you want to get your stations up and running efficiently.
            
                You can add modules, view input-output of single modules, get summaries of one module class and a complete station overview
                with highlighted deficit and surplus. This allows you to calculate, how many modules of each class you need to build a
                self-sufficient station.</p>
