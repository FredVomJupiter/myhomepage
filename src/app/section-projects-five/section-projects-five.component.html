            <p>The X-series is my favorite scifi-space game series. It was created by the small developer team "Egosoft"
                in WÃ¼rselen. Building space stations with the module sandbox system is the most fun. It requires a lot of planning
                though, if you want to get your stations up and running efficiently.</p>
